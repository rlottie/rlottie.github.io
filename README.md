## Introduction
PrettyView is the most convenient lottie web player. It is created to help communication between designers and developers. Not only does PrettyView helps designers and developers to check if the animation is rendered well on the website, but PrettyView also allows to customize animation layers.

- **Simple Customization**: In the left panel, users can access each layer by keypath. In the right panel, you can easily adjust properties such as color, opacity, and position, and find out the immediate changes.
